# HW1 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Welcome to my first homework assignment in the Coding Bootcamp! The objective of the assignment was to take the given HTML and CSS files for Horiseon Company Website -- a company for Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing -- and refact the existing code to improve search engine optimization.  

## The Prompt

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## The Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Process

In order to refact the code to comply with the acceptance criteria, I:
**Utilized comment dividers and created comments to guide the user through the code and its purpose**
**Restructured the html/css elements to fall in sequential order**
**Added alt tags with relevant titles for each img**
**Renamed the website title element along with other irrelevant element names**
**Consolidated html/css elements to improve consistency for a cleaner coder**
