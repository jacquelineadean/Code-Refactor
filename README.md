# Code Refactor

Welcome to my first homework assignment in the Coding Bootcamp! The objective of the assignment was to take the given HTML and CSS files for Horiseon Company Website -- a company for Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing -- and refact the existing code to improve search engine optimization.  

## Process

In order to refact the code to comply with the acceptance criteria, I:


**Utilized comment dividers and created comments to guide the user through the code and its purpose**


**Restructured the html/css elements to fall in sequential order**


**Added alt tags with relevant titles for each img**


**Renamed the website title element along with other irrelevant element names**


**Consolidated html/css elements to improve consistency for a cleaner coder**
